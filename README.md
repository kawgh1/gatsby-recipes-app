# Gastby Recipes App

- Based off course https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/

- First make sure Gatsby-CLI is installed
  - **npm install -g gatsby-cli**
- Then build new project
  - **gatsby new tutorial https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world**
    - Gatsby provides a number of already configured beautiful starter templates which is where this very basic Hello World was taken from
      - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/
- To spin up in the browser at **localhost:8000** enter:
  - **gatsby develop**

# Looking at the basic File Structure

- **.cache** - this is the gatsby cache - no reason to mess with this
- **node_modules** - no reason to mess with this
- **public** - same as always
- **src** - same as always
- **static** - here we can put resources that will be publicly available - however, do **NOT** dump all your image files here and think you are done. Files from this static folder are not optimized and receive no Gatsby magic when referenced directly from this folder alone without further code configurations

# Useful Commands (scripts from package.json)

- **gatsby build**
- **gatsby serve** - takes the build and gives you a production version of the app on **localhost:9000**
- **gatsby clean** - Very useful when working with images and other resources, sometimes too many code changes on the same asset can cause glitches with Gatsby optimizations - this command clears the .cache, public folders and regenerates them fresh
  - If you get an bizarre error and not sure what it is, run **gatsby clean** first

# Gatsby Plugins

- https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins
- **Styled Components**

  - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/?=styled
  - Install

    npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components

# Normalize.css

- #### This is a React thing, not a Gatsby plugin

- #### What does it do?

  - #### Similar to doing the "border-box" and "margin:0" on the global styles, but corrects for a lot more and adjusts for browser compatibility etc.

    - Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
    - Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
    - Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
    - Improves usability with subtle modifications.
    - Explains what code does using detailed comments.
    - **npm install normalize.css**
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize.css
    - in `src/components/Layout.js`
      - just `import 'normalize.css'`

# Cool Tricks

- ### Footer
  - Instead of hard coding the year make it a Javascipt date object
    - &copy; {new Date().getFullYear()}
    - This will always display the current year so dont have old copyright dates
- ### Lorem Ipsum

  - Easy Lorem Ipsum tool allows to specify number of paragraphs with english words
  - https://hipsum.co/

- ### Icons

  - React Icons
  - https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
  - **npm install react-icons --save**

- ### Free Images

# Gatsby Goodies

- Here is a list of Gatsby goodies that Gatsby does behind the scenes

- ### activeClassName

  - allows easy styling of Navbar link when page is currently on that link
    - activeClassName="active-link"

- ### Responsive Image Optimizations
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images
  - https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/learn/lecture/25538934#notes
  - Gatsby builds true-to-size image placeholders and generates a flat image placeholder until each image loads - this way the screen is not jumping around while images load
  - Gatsby also generates multiple sizes of every image and provides them to the browser to pick the best one for that browser on that screen size
  - Gatsby also generates the image attributes for SEO <picture> <srcset> <source>
  - All of this is automatic with the **Gatsby Image Plugin**
  - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/
  - **npm install gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-sharp**
  - **Configuration Docs**
  - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image/

# Gatsby & GraphQL

- ## Gatsby - GraphQL Data Flow \\\/

  - **DATA** - (APIs, Headless CMS, JSON, Markdown, SiteMetaData)
  - **GRAPHQL**
  - **GraphiQL Browser Dashboard** - for testing queries
  - **`<StaticQuery>` and `<PageQuery>`**
    - Static Queries are for regular components
    - Gatsby also allows the `useStaticQuery` Hook
    - Page queries can only be used on Page components and can accept variables
  - **REACT COMPONENTS** - Page, Title, Heading

- ## SiteMetaData

  - add Site meta data in gatsby-config.js to pull from anywhere in the app - useful for SEO

    File: gatsby-config.js

        siteMetadata: {
              title: 'Simply Recipes',
              description: 'Nice and clean recipes site',
              author: 'John Doe'
        }

  - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/

# Gatsby Plugins

- ### gatsby-source-filesystem

  - A Gatsby source plugin for sourcing data into your Gatsby application from your local filesystem.

  - The plugin creates File nodes from files. The various ‚Äútransformer‚Äù plugins can transform File nodes into various other types of data e.g. gatsby-transformer-json transforms JSON files into JSON data nodes and gatsby-transformer-remark transforms markdown files into MarkdownRemark nodes from which you can query an HTML representation of the markdown.
  - **npm install gatsby-source-filesystem**
  - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem
  - ## The point of this plugin is it allows you to access files you specify within your GraphQL queries

          query MyQuery {
            allFile {
              totalCount
              nodes {
                relativePath
              }
            }
          }

    - This returns all the files specified in gatsby-config.js and their relative path

      {

          "data": {
              "allFile": {
                  "totalCount": 12,
                  "nodes": [
                      {
                      "relativePath": "404.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "about.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "contact.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "recipes.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "index.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "tags.js"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "logo.svg"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "about.jpeg"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "main.jpeg"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "recipe-1.jpeg"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "big copy.jpg"
                      },
                      {
                      "relativePath": "big.jpg"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          },

  Gatsby's hello-world starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üöÄ Quick start (Gatsby Cloud)

Deploy this starter with one click on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/):

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
